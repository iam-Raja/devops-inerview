## Intro
* Sure, thank you! As you already know, I am Raja. I have a total of 2 years of experience  as a DevOps Engineer. In my career, I have primarily worked with AWS as cloud environments. In these cloud environments, I have gained experience with multiple services such as EC2 instances, VPCs, Auto Scaling Groups, load balancers, public and private subnets, Route 53, S3 buckets, and EKS clusters.
Regarding major DevOps tools and technologies, I have worked extensively with Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines and Ansible for configuration management. I have also used Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code tool and have written multiple Docker files. We host these Docker containers inside Kubernetes clusters.
In addition to these tools, I have been working with the Prometheus stack for service monitoring and the ELK stack for log monitoring. I have also worked with Linux machines for the past 2 years, which has helped me become proficient in Shell scripting and Python scripting. This is a brief overview of my background
